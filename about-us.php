								<h2>What is Hardware Library?</h2>
								<p>Hardware Library started because of a dream. A dream to be able to experience the wonders
								that is the technology of the 21st century. In a world where our tech is not only
								being improved upon but revolutionized, we consistently watch the impossible become a reality.
								But there is one barrier that is difficult to overcome and prevents
								developers, early-adopters, even the average consumer from enjoying these advancements.
								</p>
								<p>Money.</p>
								<p>I had this problem. As a programming hobbiest, I was always keeping up with the next big
								thing. In my time, it was the Oculus Rift. Virtual reality was taking off
								and I wanted to get in on it. But I couldn't afford one and so I was relegated to the sidelines.
								 I searched endlessly for a cheaper alternative but none could be found unless I
								joined an organizaton or took classes at a university. Nothing helped me experience what I wanted
								 without breaking the bank. So I created Hardware Library. By carrying the brunt of the costs, we
								 allow people like you to experience the latest cutting-edge technology as soon as it's available, at
								 a fraction of the cost.</p>
								<p>With adhoc rentals, people can try things out before they buy them, rent hardware for events,
								or even just satisfy that itch to try something cool. </p>
								<p>For the developer or early adopter who doesn't want to pay a fluctuating price for every item,
								we have our memberships. By paying a small amount per month, they have access to
								all of the hardware and the flexibility to renew their rentals automatically!</p>
								<p>Now there is an alternative. </p>
								<p>Now we can all experience what it feels like to live in the 21st century.</p>
								<p>Now there is Hardware Library.</p>
